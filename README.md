Simple minimodem BBS with 3D printed acoustic coupler case.

The acoustic coupler was designed to hold USB speaker and microphone. I purchased them on Adafruit

Requires Linux. PJSUA and minimodem must be installed. The BBS uses shell scripts and javascript to relay messages via minimodem over VoIP.
Start PJSUA then start the phoneMonitor.sh script

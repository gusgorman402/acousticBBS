# acousticBBS
Simple minimodem BBS with 3D printed acoustic coupler case.
The acoustic coupler was designed to hold USB speaker and microphone. I purchased them on Adafruit

Requires Linux. PJSUA and minimodem must be installed. The BBS uses shell scripts and javascript to relay messages via minimodem over VoIP
